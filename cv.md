> My goal is to become a junior developer in a three year. The most important my strength is the ability to learn and to understand the logic of processes. Engaged in the design of sites on Wordpress. There was no longer enough knowledge and skills and it became interesting to learn how to do something from scratch.

### Skills

> Have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS.

### Code example

```
let isPlay = false;
    const audio = new Audio(); 

    function playAudio() {
        audio.src = playList[playNum].src;
        audio.currentTime = 0;
        audio.volume = .55;
        if (!isPlay) {
            audio.play();
            isPlay = true;
        } else {
            audio.pause();
            isPlay = false;
        }
```
